# Hyprland Dots

Fair warning, I've tried to keep these clean of any unnessecary pieces, and I can't guarantee everything will work for you. There may also be missing pieces!? 

this rice covers:

* Hyprland - wm
* btop - cpu graphs
* cava - audio visualiser
* dunst - notifications
* kitty - terminal client
* rofi - launcher
* swaylock-effects - lockscreen
* waybar - bar
* slurp - screenshots
* wf-recorder - screenrecording

Feel free to leave comments and/or feedback!
